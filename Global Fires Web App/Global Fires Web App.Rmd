# Overview

App Location: https://davidblumenstiel.shinyapps.io/Global_Fire_Stats_1997-2015/

The Shiny R app I have created contains visualizations pertaining to the carbon content of various types of fires, the years in which they happened, which countries they occurred in, and the areas of land burned from 1997 to 2015.  The data was published by the Center for International Earth Science Information Network at Columbia University in 2017, and is publicly available here: https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/sdei-global-fire-emissions-indicators-country-level-1997-2015.  There are six visualizations in total, including three graphs and three interactive (optionally animated) maps.
These visualizations are important for understanding the geography (by country) and amount of carbon and land burned in fires from 1997 to 2015.  They highlight both significant events and continuing trends in fires of different types (wildfires, agricultural waste burning, etc.).  This app is a tool for exploring the impact and severity of fires in different regions, throughout the timeline.  Different metrics such as carbon burned per capita, proportion of countries burned, and carbon released from different types of fires are included.
Several specific trends and events are highlighted in the captions of each figure, although there are likely many more to be found.  Exploration is encouraged.

# Creation

## Data Import
First, we import the data-sets, and load the libraries we'll be using.  

The data was acquired as an Excel workbook from : ttps://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/sdei-global-fire-emissions-indicators-country-level-1997-2015.  Total carbon contents (TCC) were origionlly separated out into different sheets within the workbook by the type of fire.  Within Excel, the different sheets containing TCC data were combined and exported in .csv format.  Area Burned was contained separately in the workbook, and was also exported as a .csv file.  Both files were then uploaded to GitHub for ease of access.

```{r}
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(rnaturalearthdata)
library(viridis)
library(forcats)
library(paletteer)

```


```{r}
#data source: https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/sdei-global-fire-emissions-indicators-country-level-1997-2015


#Custom data combination of total carbon content per country per year for different types of fires.
TCC <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidblumenstiel/Portfolio_2022/main/Global%20Fires%20Web%20App/data/sedi_global_fires_all_TCC.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#Area burned per year by country
Area_burned <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidblumenstiel/Portfolio_2022/main/Global%20Fires%20Web%20App/data/sedi_global_fires_area_burned.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```



Below is a quick peek at the data.

```{r}
head(TCC)

head(Area_burned)
```

There are two data-sets: TCC, which contains information on the total carbon content burned per country by year for different types of fires, and Area_burned, which has the area of land burned in each country per year.  The data needs some basic preparation before 

## Data Preparation

First, there's a few variables we won't need.  There are codes for each country, some of which are redundant and can be removed.  There are also some datatypes that need to be changed.  The 'Type' and 'Country' variables should be changed to factors, and all of the carbon and land measurements should be changed to numeric.  Changing the carbon and land measurements to numeric will also require removing commas.  In addition, we'll want the data in a long format with years contained in rows as well (right now it's wide format); this requires a pivot.  


```{r}
#Prepping TCC
TCC <- TCC %>% rename(ISOCODE = `ï..ISOCODE`) #renames isocode
TCC[,c("CIESINCODE")] <- NULL #Get's rid a code column
TCC[,c("COUNTRY","Type")] <- lapply(TCC[,c("COUNTRY","Type")], as.factor) #changes country and type to factor
TCC[,4:23] <- lapply(TCC[,4:23], function(x) as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x))) #Changes carbon data from char to numeric
levels(TCC$Type) <- c("Agricultural Waste", "Boreal Forest", "Tropical Deforestation and Degradation", "Peat", "Savanna, Grassland and Shrub-land","Temperate Forest")

#calculates total fires per year per country
fire_totals <- data.frame(lapply(TCC[,4:22], function(x) aggregate(x ~  TCC$ISOCODE, FUN = sum)))
fire_totals[,c(seq(3,37,2))] <- NULL #gets rid of some redundancies
fire_totals["Type"] <- "Total"    #The new factor name wil be total
colnames(fire_totals) <- c(colnames(TCC[,c(1,4:22)]),"Type")   #Sets colnames same as TCC for a bind
fire_totals["COUNTRY"] <- TCC$COUNTRY[match(fire_totals$ISOCODE, TCC$ISOCODE)] #Finds correct country names for bind
fire_totals["AVERAGE"] <- round(rowMeans(fire_totals[,2:20]),2) #Finds average of totals through all years
TCC <- rbind(TCC, fire_totals)  #Adds the totals to TCC


#Pivots TCC data to long form
colnames(TCC) <- lapply(colnames(TCC), function(x) gsub("TCC", "",x)) #Definitely better ways to do this, but this is easy
TCC <- TCC %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = !c(Type,COUNTRY,AVERAGE,ISOCODE), #Selects all columns but country, Average TCC, and Type
    names_to = "Year", #new variable name of Year for years
    names_prefix = "Y",
    values_to = "TCC_Burned" #New variable name of TCC for burn data
  )
TCC$Year <- as.numeric(TCC$Year)  

#Prepping Area_Burned
Area_burned[,c("ï..UNSDCODE","CIESINCODE")] <- NULL  #Get's rid of the code columns
Area_burned$COUNTRY <- as.factor(Area_burned$COUNTRY) #changes country and type to factor
Area_burned[,3:22] <- lapply(Area_burned[,3:22], function(x) as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x))) #Changes area data from char to numeric


#Pivots Area Burned data to long form
colnames(Area_burned) <- lapply(colnames(Area_burned), function(x) gsub("burned_ha", "",x)) #Definitely better ways to do this, but this is easy
Area_burned <- Area_burned %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = !c(COUNTRY,Area_sqkm,ISOCODE), #Selects all columns but country and area sqkm
    names_to = "Year", #new variable name of Year for years
    names_prefix = "Y",
    values_to = "Hectares_burned" #New variable name of Hectares_burned for burn data
  )
Area_burned$Year <- as.numeric(Area_burned$Year)

Area_burned <- Area_burned %>% mutate(Proportion_Burned = Hectares_burned/(Area_sqkm * 100)) #Proportion of country burned every year

```



```{r}

options(scipen=1000000)
# Cabon burned per year with types of fires
#This takes out the "Total" level, which for this figure is redundant
TCC_YearType <- aggregate(TCC_Burned ~ Year + Type, data = subset(TCC, Type != "Total"), FUN = sum)

#Initializes the plot.  Will reorder by tons burned, and set units to million tons
TCC_plot1 <- ggplot(data = TCC_YearType, aes(x = Year, y = TCC_Burned/1000000,  fill = reorder(Type, TCC_Burned))) +
  geom_area(alpha=1 , size=.05, colour="black") + #Makes it an area chart with lines inbetween classes
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Million Tons of Carbon Burned", title = "Carbon Content Burned by Year and Type", fill='Fire Type') +
  scale_y_continuous(n.breaks = 15)+ #Set's more tics
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 15, guide = guide_axis(angle = 40)) #More tics and rotates labels
  

TCC_plot1
```

(Above)
Total carbon released by fires by type of fire for years 1997-2015.  Savannah, Grassland, and Shrub-land fires are by far the most prevalent carbon source.  The two spikes  on the chart correspond primarily to the 1997 fires in Indonesia, and 2008 fires in central Africa

#Below are where we designatew the actual figures.  These will take input from user interaction and adjust the plots accordingly.  Thee will be three basic plots and three maps.

#The first plot will be the total carbon released per year by type of fire.  It will be a stacked line plot, which will highlight different contributions from different types of fire along with the total.  It will have years on the x axis and the amount of carbon released across all countries per year on the y axis.

#The second plot will be a grouped bar-plot of the proportion of land in countries burned per year, with year on the x axis and proportion on the y axis.  The bars will be groups of countries by income, as defined in the rnaturalearth's "world" dataset.  This will show how much of each country is burning each year by income group.

#The third plot will be a list of the top 20 burning countries as total carbon burned in fires from years 1997-2015 combined.  It will highligth the countries with the most burning; a barplot should work nicely.

#The first map will be of total carbon burned per year in fires, by type of fire, across all countries.  Countries with more carbon burned will be a brighter color. One will be able to select by year using a slider, or have it run through the years automatically.  One will also be able to select the type of fire.  The scale here will need to adjust automatically, and won't remain constant.

#The second map will be of the porportion of land burned per country each year.  It will have a slider for year selection.  The scale will be fixed.

#The third map will be of carbon burned per person in each country by year.  Like the other maps, it will have a year sider.  The scale will not be fixed due to outliers.
